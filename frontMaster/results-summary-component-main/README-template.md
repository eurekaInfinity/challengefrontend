## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

"I learned how to call .json files in my .js files. I tried to distribute responsibilities in the classes to invoke them in the attributes of the HTML tags and avoid repeating styles. I liked it a lot and we are going for it. Thank you for reading this, let's go all out."

### Continued development

I learned how to call .json files in my .js files.

### Useful resources

- [json](https://v8.dev/features/import-assertions) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
